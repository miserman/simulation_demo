* The following copyrights, licenses, and long comment were part of the original implementation available as part of [Go]{@link https://github.com/golang/go/blob/cb07765045aed5104a3df31507564ac99e6ddce8/src/math/exp.go}, which in turn was based on an implementation available as part of [FreeBSD]{@link https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/release/9.3.0/lib/msun/src/e_exp.c}. The implementation follows the original, but has been modified for JavaScript.
